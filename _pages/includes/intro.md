I'm Zhen Wang, currently pursuing my Ph.D. diploma at Beijing Institute of Technology, under the guidance of [Prof. Liheng Bian ](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=66IFMDEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), focusing on computational imaging method and imaging processing algorithm.

My current research interests are mainly about **snapshot** **hyperspectral imaging, polarization imaging and computational imaging**. Specifically, I focus on efficiently acquiring and processing of hyperspectral images and polarization images, including the spectral coding, polarization filters, sensor integration, and computational reconstruction. I investigate deeper with various compressive sensing and deep learning algorithms to enhance the performance of the high-dimensional imaging.
